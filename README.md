Polarised norm change simulation

Steps to follow:

1) Copy/download repository in a directory on your personal computer: Open as R project with the file "tipping_review.Rproj" to have automatic setting of working directory.

2) First execute the simulation with sim.R. Output of simulation should then automatically be stored in working directory.

3) Execute plots.R to produce the plots. For this, working directory needs to be set to where output of simulation is. If steps before worked, this should work automatically.
